# Clubhouse-EDA
* We take a dive into the highly popular iOS only invite-only audio chat app, Clubhouse.
* Link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/johntukey/clubhouse-dataset?select=Clubhouse_Dataset_v1.db 
* We divide users in differet clusters and analyse them based on their profile completeness.
* User Bio is not available in the used dataset. So we can analyse emojis for emoji based ad targetting similar to twitter. 
* For analysis based on emojis a fair assumption has been made that emoji's are more of a personal touch.
